# Pong Game

Pong, a classic arcade game. Developed by Atari in 1972 and designed by Allan Alcorn.  
The game consists of a two-dimensional screen with a rectangular play area. On either side of the play area,
there are vertical paddles, one controlled by player and one controlled by AI. The objective of the game is
to hit a small ball back and forth using the paddles, trying to score points by getting the ball past the 
opponent's paddle.  

In my implementation of Pong I've added new features to make the game more
challenging and engaging. (You can explore it in experimental mode)
First player to reach third score wins the game. (Best Of 5)

# Game Details

Use the mouse cursor to move your paddle.  
There are four difficulty modes. Each mode offers different game experience.

## Easy Mode

Classic Pong experience. Perfect for beginners. It offers slower ball and enemy paddle speeds.  
Enjoy the classic Pong experience in a stress-free environment.


## Normal Mode

Classic Pong experince. It provides more challenging and well-balanced gameplay experience.  
More responsive enemy paddle movements.


## Hard Mode

Classic Pong experience with overwhelming enemy. Hard difficulty level pushes the limits with faster ball speeds and highly reactive paddle movements. A true test for your reflexes.

## Experimental Mode

Experience the new features and power-ups, while facing unpredictable challenges and game-changing elements.  
This level is perfect for players who want to explore the beyond of Pong.   
At this stage, I've introduced three power-ups to enhance the gameplay. Power-ups will spawn randomly within the play area. You must collect them by hitting the ball.  
If you have any power-up ideas you'd like to see implemented, please don't hesitate to share them with me.  
I'd be truly grateful for this. You can contact with me via [E-mail][mail]
